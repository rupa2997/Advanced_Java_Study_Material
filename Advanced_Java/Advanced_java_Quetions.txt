1.What is Servlet
--Servlet is a technology which is used to create a scalable and robust web application.
--it is platform independent server-side component
Servlet is an API that provides many interfaces and classes including documentation.
Servlet is an interface that must be implemented for creating any Servlet.
Servlet is a class that extends the capabilities of the servers and responds to the incoming requests. It can respond to any requests.
Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page.


--Servlet is a Java technology that helps to develop scalable and robust web applications. It is a platform-independent server-side component. Moreover, it is possible to write a Servlet using three methods: by implementing Servlet interface, by extending GenericServlet abstract class or by extending the HttpServlet abstract class. The Servlet interface is the super interface for both GenericServlet and HttpServlet. It has five abstract methods, and GenericServlet and HttpServlet inherit these methods.
2.Difference between generic and Http servlet
--generic servlet is protocol independent servlet.can be used with any protocol such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and, CGI
--It is Avaible in javax.servlet.servlet.package
--generic servlet is an abstarct class which extends object and implements Servlet, ServletConfig, and java.io..Serializable interfaces
-generic sevlets should overide the service method,
however service is already implemented in http servlet







--Http servlet is platform dependent servlet.it is suitable for only http servlet
--It is Avaible in javax.servlet.http.package
--the direct subclass to GenericServle is httpServlet.
--HttpServlets override doGet() to handle GET request and doPost() to handle POST  requests.
--other HttpServlet Methods are also available

A class that implements Servlet, ServletConfig and Serializable interface that provide the implementation of all the methods of these interfaces except the service method

Protocol-independent

Service method is abstract

Immediate subclass of Servlet interface

public abstract class extends java.lang.Object, and
implements Servlet.

class which extends the Generic Servlet class and implements Serializable interface that provides HTTP specific methods

Protocol-dependent 

Service method is non abstract

Immediate subclass of Generic Servlet

public abstract class extends and, GenereServlet
implements

java.io.Scrializable

Defined by javax.servlet.http package

40.forward and include method
The forward() method is used to transfer the client request to another resource (HTML file, servlet, jsp etc). When this method is called, the control is transferred to the next resource called. On the other hand, the include() method is used to include the content of the calling file into the called file. After calling this method, the control remains with the calling resource, but the processed output is included into the called resource.
